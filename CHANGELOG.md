# Change Log

## NOTICE - THE PROJECT IS ABANDONED (2018-06-28)

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/develop)

### Added

- More details when throwing "Component method invoked with non-Component as 'this'".

## [2.0.0 - 2018-03-17](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v2.0.0)

### Added

- Actions are now opt-in and declared via the `action` decorator.
- Dynamic component class name generation - generated components name follows
  the following pattern: "OriginalClassName_ReduxAppComponent" (As a consequence
  the `emitClassNames` was removed as it is no longer needed).
- Improve overall performance (remove state "finalization" step).

### Changed

- `uppercaseActions` option defaults to false.
- Rename SchemaOptions to ActionOptions
- Don't remove getters from state.

### Removed

- Remove 5 decorators: `component`, `connect`, `computed`, `method` and `noDispatch`.
- Remove `convertToPlainObject` option.
- Remove package-lock.json (using yarn.lock).

### Fixed

- Fix duplicate component creation when created from the same template instance.

## [1.11.1 - 2018-02-27](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.11.1)

### Deprecated

- The use of `connect` deprecated and **will be remove in the next version**.

  There are several reasons for that: it is a source of bugs, it makes other
  features harder to implement and it encourages a pseudo dependency injection
  anti-pattern (DI is great, the pseudo form that `connect` encourage isn't -
  if you want to use DI you should use a proper DI container).

### Fixed

- Fix `ReduxApp.getComponent` typings.

## [1.11.0 - 2018-02-03](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.11.0)

### Added

- New `ReduxApp` static method: `getComponent`. Primarily aimed for better
  integration with React (check out the new react
  [examples](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app-examples/blob/master/src/react)).
- yarn.lock file.

### Changed

- Differentiate between `noDispatch` and `sequence` methods. The first stays the
  same while the latter changed. From now on `sequence` methods has a double
  role. First, it **dispatches** an action which is **ignored** by the reducer.
  Second, it's being invoked as a regular method as it used to. While this
  change should not have any actual impact on application behavior it makes it
  easier to debug and track the flow of the application (through the various
  Redux loggers out there).

## [1.10.3 - 2017-12-21](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.10.3)

### Added

- Support for symbol polyfill. This enables the use of redux-app even with IE (tested with [core-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js)).

## [1.10.2 - 2017-12-21](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.10.2)

### Added

- New schema option: `actionNamespaceSeparator`.
- Update `computed` values only if they are not deeply equal (using lodash.isEqual).
  Controlled via the `ReduxApp.options.computed.deepComparison` option.

### Changed

- Lock dependencies versions.

### Removed

- Remove the unused `inheritMethods` schema option.

### Fixed

- Global `SchemaOptions` handling.

## [1.9.0 - 2017-11-29](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.9.0)

### Added

- New decorator: `ignoreState`.
- Allow `noDispatch` calls inside actions.
- Significant performance boost (reducers and update state logic refactored).

### Removed

- Breaking change: Can no longer use the `computed` decorator on non-components.

### Changed

- Some log messages changed/removed.

## [1.8.1 - 2017-11-18](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.8.0)

- package-lock.json

## [1.8.0 - 2017-11-16](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.8.0)

### Added

- Component inheritance.
- Return value from `noDispatch` methods.
- More informative errors and warnings.
- Check out the new [real world example](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app-examples/tree/master/src/angular/gladiators) in the [examples project](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app-examples).

### Changed

- Npm package only contains the source and dist files.
- Update docs.

### Fixed

- Fix `computed` properties that are based on `connect`ed values.
- Fix reduction of arrays of objects when the array is initially undefined.

## [1.7.2 - 2017-11-08](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.7.2)

### Added

- Expose and document the convertToPlainObject global option.

### Changed

- Use wepback's ModuleConcatenationPlugin to reduce library footprint and increase loading efficiency.

## [1.7.1 - 2017-11-05](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.7.1)

### Fixed

- Fix time travel.
- Fix and shorten some log messages.

## [1.7.0 - 2017-11-04](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.7.0)

### Added

- Connection of components inside the app tree is now stable.
- The `computed` decorator is now stable.
- Can use the `computed` decorator on non-components (although must still be used inside the app tree).

### Changed

- Connected components sources are persisted only in the ReduxApp tree (and not in the store).
- Computed values are persisted only in the ReduxApp tree (and not in the store).
- Internal code organization changes.

### Fixed

- Fix potential collision of connected components with IDs.

## [1.6.0 - 2017-10-31](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.6.0)

### Added

- New decorator: connect.
- New static method ReduxApp.create (same as invoking the constructor directly, meant to help avoiding lint warnings).
- withId can be used without the parenthesis.

### Changed

- Marked the `computed` decorator as experimental (requires further testing and validation).
- Set default log level to `LogLevel.Warn`.
- Remove some verbose log messages.

### Fixed

- Avoid invoking getters unnecessarily when probing for Component methods.
- Improve updateState logic. Array handling logic in specific.
- Improve pre-loaded state handling.

## [1.5.2 - 2017-10-25](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.5.2)

### Changed

- Updated type definitions (d.ts file).
- Updated package exports (index.ts).

## [1.5.1 - 2017-10-25](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.5.1)

### Added

- New decorator: `computed`.
- New utility function: `isInstanceOf`.
- New global option: `emitClassNames`.
- Handle pre-loaded state.

### Changed

- When updating state do not remove component properties that exists on the state but are undefined.
- The `updateState` option is now an app level option instead of a component level option.
- Throw if component method is invoked with non-component as 'this'.
- Verbose logs are emitted using `console.debug` instead of `console.log`.

### Fixed

- Major refactor to the library's internals that address several issues. The primary issues were:
  1. All patched methods were store on the same Component prototype. This would mean that two different classes having a method with the same name will dispatch the same action.
  2. Updates to components nested inside regular objects were not applied correctly.

## [1.4.0 - 2017-10-22](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.4.0)

### Added

- Components are connected to the store even if nested inside non-component objects.
- Unit tests.

## [1.3.0 - 2017-10-21](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.3.0)

### Added

- No limitations on component constructor (required parameter-less constructor before).

### Fixed

- Fix bug in getReducer and nested components.

## [1.2.0 - 2017-10-19](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.2.0)

### Added

- New decorators: `withId`, `noDispatch` and `sequence`.

## [1.0.3 - 2017-10-19](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app/tree/v1.0.3)

### Added

- Packed as a UMD package.

## [0.0.0 - 2017-10-19](https://github.com/alonrbar/redux-app)
